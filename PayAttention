1. Mask within each Thred
2. Block all signals - when&why?
3. Do we need to store - "who is waiting for me to finish"



Some ambiguities in the description of Ex2 were identified in the exercise forum
(thanks a lot to everyone who posted them!)

This announcement should summarize the major clarifications and updates.

1. If thread A calls uthread_sync(A), treat it as an error.

2. On the subject of syncing vs. blocking, treat the two independently, so for
 example:

- If uthread_block(A) was called then thread A will not be moved into the READY
state unless uthread_resume(A) was called.

- If thread A called uthread_sync(B) then thread A will not be moved into the
 READY state unless thread B was terminated.

- If thread A called uthread_sync(B) and afterwards uthread_block(A) was called
then thread A will not be moved into the READY state unless uthread_resume(A) was
 called and thread B was terminated, in any order.


Think of these as independent conditions that must be met before moving the
 thread back to the READY state.

The syncing condition is added with uthread_sync and is removed when the target
 thread is terminated.

The blocking condition is added with uthread_block and is removed when
uthread_resume is called.
