Some ambiguities in the description of Ex2 were identified in the exercise forum (thanks a lot to everyone who posted them!)

This announcement should summarize the major clarifications and updates.

1. If thread A calls uthread_sync(A), treat it as an error.

2. On the subject of syncing vs. blocking, treat the two independently, so for example:

- If uthread_block(A) was called then thread A will not be moved into the READY state unless uthread_resume(A) was called.

- If thread A called uthread_sync(B) then thread A will not be moved into the READY state unless thread B was terminated.

- If thread A called uthread_sync(B) and afterwards uthread_block(A) was called then thread A will not be moved into
the READY state unless uthread_resume(A) was called and thread B was terminated, in any order.



Think of these as independent conditions that must be met before moving the thread back to the READY state.

The syncing condition is added with uthread_sync and is removed when the target thread is terminated.

The blocking condition is added with uthread_block and is removed when uthread_resume is called.

I hope this clears up all known issues, if you find other ambiguities or have further questions please bring
them up in the forums as soon as possible. I'll try to announce future clarifications here if there are any,
but keep in mind that forum answers are binding as well, so make sure you invest the time to read them.

I've updated the exercise description and the uthreads.h documentation to clarify this issue as well.
